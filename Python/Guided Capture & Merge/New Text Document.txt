- Imagine there are n cameras in a room placed strategically.
- The s/w can configure what percentage of videos from each camera would compile in the final content.

Eg
A singing competition
5 cameras in an auditorium
	a - focuses on judges
	b - focuses the audience
	c - focuses the musicians
	d - focuses the stage/singer
	e - focuses the anchors 

The s/w helps you configure what content from each a,b,c,d,e would be part of say a 3 minute compilation. 

Initial 30 secs 
	e - Anchor : 50%
	d - Stage/Singer : 20%
	a - Judges : 15%
	b - Audience : 15%

Next 180 secs
	d - Stage/Singer : 60%
	c - Musicians : 20%
	a - Judges : 10%
	b - Audience : 10%

Last 30 secs
	d - Stage/Singer : 30%
	a - Judges : 5%
	b - Audience : 5%
	e - Anchor : 60%

The software blends videos based on 
	a. %ages assigned
